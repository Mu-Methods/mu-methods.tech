			<p>In Zen Buddhism, Mu is a lesson to help the student let go of their perception of themselves and their identity. At Mu Methods we are building a protocol for identity to be redefined as never before, the next step to digital enlightenment.

			<br>
			(Describe how identity is managed on the Internet today, that we do not own our identity. Our identity is owned and sold by third parties. Since it is all we know it is taken for granted that this is the only way)
			<br>
			<br>
			(Go into the three pillars of the internet and their respective protocols explaining how and why our identity is managed this way. Conclude that our protocol will be the first for the pillar of identity.)

			<br>
			<br>
			We are creating this protocol by building an off-chain account management system using threshold signatures as the driving technology. This will eliminate the need for importing/exporting keys and set a standard for identity management. Our ultimate goal is to enable the use of wallets as identity for everything and keep our identity our property.

			Side note: I like an example of logging into Netflix with my public key, having an NFT I purchase with crypto monthly that will validate my login, no personal or fiat payment information shared. Will our protocol enable this type of transaction? Is this our endgame or off target?</p>
