							<b class="in-line-title">Frankie</b> <span> began working in software development in 2016 as MetaMask‚Äôs #3 hire. She stayed on the team for four years as a core dev, seeing the company through its inception, the ICO boom and bust, crypto kitties onslaught, and eventual dominance of the Ethereum wallet ecosystem. Her primary responsibility was to manage the code focusing on network connectivity, transaction construction and sending. She maintained a heavy security mindset while assisting the founder, Kumavis, in his research.
							During her tenure, Frankie realized that key management was the solution to login complexity and personal identity verification. Through her journey of p2p protocols she gained a deep understanding of the underlying technologies required to construct and execute the next step to self-sovereign identity.</span>

							<b class="in-line-title">Jugal</b> <span> started working in Web3 while finishing his BS in Finance from SFSU. Shortly before graduating he was approached to serve as Chief of Staff and Ops Lead at Balance, a crypto wallet built for Safari extensions. During his tenure he managed all company operations , including finance, community, project management, and human resources. He also represented Balance at Eth Denver Web3 building a strong network of thought leaders, founders, and investors.

							Throughout this experience, he began to understand the potential for crypto wallets to serve as a singular digital identity, leading him to co-found Mu Methods.

							Outside of the crypto world his greatest passions lie in non-profit work to empower those suffering from homelessness, mental health and addiction issues. He also serves on the San Francisco board for StartOut, developing programs and content for underrepresented founders and investors focused in the crypto and digital asset ecosystem.</span>

<!--- In Zen Buddhism, Mu is a lesson to help the student let go of their perception of themselves and their identity. At Mu Methods we are building a protocol for identity to be redefined as never before, the next step to digital enlightenment. 

The only way we know

(Describe how identity is managed on the Internet today, that we do not own our identity. Our identity is owned and sold by third parties. Since it is all we know it is taken for granted that this is the only way)

(Go into the three pillars of the internet and their respective protocols explaining how and why our identity is managed this way. Conclude that our protocol will be the first for the pillar of identity.)

The third protocol

We are creating this protocol by building an off-chain account management system using threshold signatures as the driving technology. This will eliminate the need for importing/exporting keys and set a standard for identity management. Our ultimate goal is to enable the use of wallets as identity for everything and keep our identity our property.

Side note: I like an example of logging into Netflix with my public key, having an NFT I purchase with crypto monthly that will validate my login, no personal or fiat payment information shared. Will our protocol enable this type of transaction? Is this our endgame or off target? -
