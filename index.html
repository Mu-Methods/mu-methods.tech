The Problem

		The current model of the internet exploits the individual. Organizations hold our data hostage for access to their services and platforms.
	It is exclusive and inherently discriminatory, requiring us to disclose personal information and navigate barriers to entry to participate. Every
	act online requires creating an account that provides at least a name and email, and often age, date of birth, race and ethnicity. This data is
	shared with third parties, subjecting the user to a harassment of unsolicited emails, ads, and messages. There is no telling what other uses this
	personal information is being exploited for. Once it is in an entity‚Äôs hands, it is theirs to do with as they will.
		This process is repeated again and again for Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Eventbrite, Bank of America, LinkedIn, Apple, ad infinitum,
	fracturing our identity into countless pieces and creating new vulnerabilities every time we engage with a service. The burden is on the user to
	manage access to all of these accounts for the privilege of private companies profiting from our data. This is an inefficient, broken system.
		Similarly, for every purchase made online the user has to enter their bank card or account information. This is a cumbersome and insecure
	process, creating vulnerabilities every time this data is transmitted or saved on a platforms centralized system. Blockchain technology solves the
	payment problem, requiring a user to simply sign a message to complete a transaction. However, payments are only one use case. Blockchain can also
	be used to solve the broken identity management system, simply requiring message signing to access a new platform. The protocol that will make this
	possible is what we are building at Mu Methods.

The Solution

		No longer will you be required to give up personal information and create a new identity for every platform you engage with. When you
	access a new system it will only require a message to be signed in your wallet. Platforms will be connecting to your singular digital identity
	instead of having you build a new account every time you want to access a service or join a community.

	Identity Protocol

		To accomplish this we have to fix the existing cryptographic identity system, then integrate it with payments and off-chain platforms. At
	Mu Methods we are laser-focused on step one to provide an open-source, foundational identity management infrastructure. Similar to the IPFS and
	blockchain solutions for p2p data transfer and asset management, our protocol is an open-souce off-chain solution for public/private key management
	that can be utilized by any cryptographic identity provider. This network will address three primary issues: account linking, seed phrase
	recoverability, and decentralized application connectivity.

	Account Linking

		Currently connecting crypto accounts requires a user to import/export their seed phrase making it vulnerable to attack. If the seed phrase
	is unknown, they have to export it from their wallet. The seed phrase may be stored incorrectly making it insecure. In addition, it adds a layer of
	complexity to the UX. A user may create a new account every time they use a different wallet because they don't feel comfortable importing/
	exporting their seed phrase. Instead of importing/exporting our network will generate private linking keys to permission new accounts through a
	primary account so the user does not need to access the seed phrase over and over again. Mu will generate permissioning private keys through
	aggregate threshold signatures.

	Seed Phrase Recoverability

		While this minimizes the need to access the seed phrase, it does not eliminate it. The current single failure point of seed phrases is
	unsustainable and unscalable. If a user will lose access to their account if they lose their seed phrase they are unlikely to utilize it as a safe
	and secure method of identity and asset management. To solve recoverability of seed phrases for those instances in which a user has lost complete
	access to their account we will use key sharding. Instead of holding the entire seed phrase in one location it will be split and distributed among
	several nodes in the network. It is social recovery without the need of smart contracts or friends to distribute the shards to. If the user does
	not have trusted friends they will be provided with alternative locations for shard distribution. They will not be required to store their seed
	phrase.

	Decentralized Application Connectivity

		In order to transition to the single-tap connectivity necessary to access platforms with our digital ID's, wallet connect standards need an
	update. Currently a user needs to choose which wallet they are connecting from to communicate with a dapp. Our network will remove this step, no
	longer requiring the user to choose their wallet. When a dapp proposes to sign a transaction it will go through our network to be signed by any
	device key. Rather than requesting the local account, the dapp is told what account is going to sign for which transaction. All keys will act from
	one device/account.

	Verified Credentials

		Once these features are functioning the personal identification details required to engage with certain platforms ie. name, age, address,
	email, social security number, etc. will be securely stored on the same network. These proven personal identifiers are referred to as verified
	credentials. They are private and only accessible if a user permissions them to be. For example, when a bank requires verified identifiers to
	engage with a client the user can one-tap permission access to the specific and limited information they need.

	Financial Transactions

		While crypo payments are functional, they are not scalable. We are closely following legislation in the US and abroad regarding Central
	Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) and stablecoins. Once crypto is legally defined traditional platforms compliance departments ie. Netflix,
	Eventbrite, etc. will have a clear path to accepting crypo payments. Integrating these into the digital identities built on our network will
	eliminate the attack vectors created when financial account information is exposed.

Transition

		We will begin onboarding to the network through pull requests and wallet reviews of the largest wallet providers by UAW. Additionally we
	will build a proof of concept wallet to demonstrate the networks functionality and security best practices. These strategies will upgrade existing
	wallet infrastructure as well as set a standard for new wallet providers.
		Our vision will take several years to realize and require collaboration with companies across the Web3 ecosystem working on verified
	credentials, payment systems, and KYC integration. It is going to take many solutions to build this reality. If there are potential synergies
	between your product and ours please contact us. We are eager to work together and solve identity management as a community.

						<span class="in-line-tittle">Frankie</span> began working in software development in 2016 as MetaMask‚Äôs #3 hire. She stayed on the team for four years as a core dev, seeing the company through its inception, the ICO boom and bust, crypto kitties onslaught, and eventual dominance of the Ethereum wallet ecosystem. Her primary responsibility was to manage the code focusing on network connectivity, transaction construction and sending. She maintained a heavy security mindset while assisting the founder, Kumavis, in his research.
	During her tenure, Frankie realized that key management was the solution to login complexity and personal identity verification. Through her journey of p2p protocols she gained a deep understanding of the underlying technologies required to construct and execute the next step to self-sovereign identity.

	<span class="in-line-tittle">Jugal</span> started working in Web3 while finishing his BS in Finance from SFSU. Shortly before graduating he was approached to serve as Chief of Staff and Ops Lead at Balance, a crypto wallet built for Safari extensions. During his tenure he managed all company operations , including finance, community, project management, and human resources. He also represented Balance at Eth Denver Web3 building a strong network of thought leaders, founders, and investors.

<!--- In Zen Buddhism, Mu is a lesson to help the student let go of their perception of themselves and their identity. At Mu Methods we are building a protocol for identity to be redefined as never before, the next step to digital enlightenment. 

The only way we know

(Describe how identity is managed on the Internet today, that we do not own our identity. Our identity is owned and sold by third parties. Since it is all we know it is taken for granted that this is the only way)

(Go into the three pillars of the internet and their respective protocols explaining how and why our identity is managed this way. Conclude that our protocol will be the first for the pillar of identity.)

The third protocol

We are creating this protocol by building an off-chain account management system using threshold signatures as the driving technology. This will eliminate the need for importing/exporting keys and set a standard for identity management. Our ultimate goal is to enable the use of wallets as identity for everything and keep our identity our property.

Side note: I like an example of logging into Netflix with my public key, having an NFT I purchase with crypto monthly that will validate my login, no personal or fiat payment information shared. Will our protocol enable this type of transaction? Is this our endgame or off target? -
