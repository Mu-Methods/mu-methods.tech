				<span><span class="in-line-title">Frankie</span> began working in software development in 2016 as MetaMask‚Äôs #3 hire. She stayed on the team for four years as a core dev, seeing the company through its inception, the ICO boom and bust, crypto kitties onslaught, and eventual dominance of the Ethereum wallet ecosystem. Her primary responsibility was to manage the code focusing on network connectivity, transaction construction and sending. She maintained a heavy security mindset while assisting the founder, Kumavis, in his research.
				During her tenure, Frankie realized that key management was the solution to login complexity and personal identity verification. Through her journey of p2p protocols she gained a deep understanding of the underlying technologies required to construct and execute the next step to self-sovereign identity.</span>

				<span><span class="in-line-title">Jugal</span> started working in Web3 while finishing his BS in Finance from SFSU. Shortly before graduating he was approached to serve as Chief of Staff and Ops Lead at Balance, a crypto wallet built for Safari extensions. During his tenure he managed all company operations , including finance, community, project management, and human resources. He also represented Balance at Eth Denver Web3 building a strong network of thought leaders, founders, and investors.

				Outside of the crypto world his greatest passions lie in non-profit work to empower those suffering from homelessness, mental health and addiction issues. He also serves on the San Francisco board for StartOut, developing programs and content for underrepresented founders and investors focused in the crypto and digital asset ecosystem.</span>
